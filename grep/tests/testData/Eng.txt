New Year’s is a holiday that we are always looking forward to. It is a time that we spend with our families and friends, relaxing and exchanging presents. Each family has its own traditions and customs and the way they spend this day.

As for me and my family, we consider New Year’s a family holiday and always spend it together. We start preparing for this very carefully, usually several days before the celebration. It’s always very important to choose the right presents for the whole family and friends. Generally, we tell each other what we want for a gift, but sometimes we give each other surprise presents. It is my favorite part of the New Year’s preparations because I like to look out for perfect gifts for my family.

In the middle of December, we buy a New Year’s tree, which we decorate with my parents. It’s a tradition because it brings us together and we really have fun doing it. Also, before New Year’s Day, we always clean the house and create a festive atmosphere. I like to decorate the house with paper snowflakes, candles, and garlands.

My mother and I always cook a holiday meal together. Usually, we make a lot of different traditional food. For example, Olivier salad, dressed herring, kholodets, different pies and we also bake cookies. Our table for the celebration is always covered with delicious food.

When it’s almost midnight we gather at the celebratory table to say good-bye to the outgoing year and to wish the best to each other. It is a family tradition to watch a holiday concert on TV and to listen to the president's speech. After that, we exchange gifts and then go outside to watch fireworks, to take a walk, to meet our neighbors and congratulate everyone with the New Year. Sometimes we like to play snowballs.

After that we go home, we play guitar and exchange gifts. It is a happy time because I can see the joy on the faces of my family members. I like New Year's the most because it gives genuine emotion of happiness and family unity. happy new year.

Happy New Year!
